# MasterThesisSSC
This repository contains code for my my master thesis about the storage incentives in Swarm.
In it we have implemented two alternative redistribution smart contracts, alpha, and bank.
They can be found in folders SwarmStorageContractAlpha, and SwarmStorageContractBank respectively.
While the unchanged existing redistribution contract from Swarm that we based our work on is in warmStorageContractUnchanged.
To run tests on the contracts with truffle we can navigate to the test subfolder and run the respective truffle test.

The experimental data gained by running RealDataTest.js is stored in the data folder.
While the python scripts used to analyse the code is in python-scripts folder.
